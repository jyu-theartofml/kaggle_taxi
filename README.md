# Data visualization of taxi rides (R and Python)

R libraries (ggmap, ggplot) and Python's Folium package are used to visualize the taxi data set from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration). The goal is to explore and compare the different mapping features within R and Python.

### R visualization 








Note: for the python jupyter notebook (taxi_1.ipynb) it's best to view it on NBviewer because it renders the interactive maps.
